# Distentio Focus Recovery

Diagnose and remedy attention fragmentation using Augustine's threefold present (memory, attention, expectation) to restore focused productivity and gather the scattered self.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for diagnosis and recovery plan.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Provide focus recovery plans that enable harmful obsession or workaholism
- Ignore legitimate competing demands (family, health, ethics) in favor of "productivity"
- Treat all scattered attention as disorder - some situations genuinely require distributed attention
- Promise permanence - *intentio* is a practice, not a one-time fix

**If asked to help obsessive over-focus:** Redirect to healthy boundaries. True *intentio* gathers toward what matters most, which includes rest and relationship.

---

## When to Use

- Feeling scattered, overwhelmed, or pulled in too many directions
- Context-switching is exhausting and degrading quality
- Unable to concentrate despite wanting to
- The "scattered self" - knowing what to do but unable to do it
- User says "I can't focus," "Too many priorities," "I'm all over the place"
- Project paralysis from competing demands

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **current_state** | Yes | Description of what's pulling attention and how it feels |
| **competing_demands** | Yes | List of things claiming attention |
| **desired_focus** | No | What the person wants to focus on (if known) |
| **symptoms** | No | Specific manifestations (anxiety, paralysis, poor quality work) |

---

## Workflow
### 1. Name the Distentio

*Distentio animi* - the soul stretched between memory, attention, and expectation, torn apart by temporality.

**Diagnose how the soul is being stretched:**

| Faculty | Symptom | Questions |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Memory** (past) | Regret, resentment, "should have" thinking | What past events are claiming present attention? |
| **Attention** (present) | Scattered, anxious, unable to rest in now | What is actually happening right now that requires attention? |
| **Expectation** (future) | Anxiety, planning obsession, deadline fear | What future fears are stretching the present? |

### 2. Identify False Urgencies

Not everything claiming attention deserves it. Separate:

- **True present demands:** Actually happening now, actually requiring your attention
- **Memory ghosts:** Past events that keep replaying but cannot be changed
- **Expectation phantoms:** Future possibilities being treated as present realities
- **Other people's urgencies:** Demands that feel urgent but aren't yours to carry

### 3. Practice Intentio

*Intentio* - the gathering of the scattered self toward what truly matters.

**The practice:**

### Step 1: **Acknowledge the stretch:** "I am being pulled between X, Y, and Z"



### Step 2: **Release what is not present:** Past cannot be changed; future is not yet



### Step 3: **Name one thing:** What single thing most deserves present attention?



### Step 4: **Set aside, don't abandon:** Other demands will have their time; they don't have now



### 4. Reframe the Threefold Present

Transform scattered faculties into focused resources:

| Faculty | From Distentio | To Intentio |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Memory** | Haunting, regret, rumination | Resource: What have I learned that serves this work? |
| **Attention** | Scattered, fragmented | Present: What is the one thing now? |
| **Expectation** | Anxiety, fear, planning obsession | Direction: Where is this leading? (held lightly) |

### 5. Establish Recovery Practice

Focus is not achieved once but practiced repeatedly. Establish:

- **Gathering moments:** Points in the day to practice *intentio*
- **Boundary rituals:** How to transition between demands without carrying all simultaneously
- **Permission to defer:** Explicit acknowledgment that other demands have their time, not now

## Outputs

**Distentio Diagnosis & Recovery Plan:**

```markdown
## Focus Recovery: [Person/Situation]

### The Distentio (How the Soul is Stretched)

**Memory pulling toward past:**
- [What past events are claiming attention]

**Expectation pulling toward future:**
- [What future fears are stretching the present]

**Present fragmentation:**
- [What is actually happening vs. what is imagined]

### False Urgencies Identified

| Demand | Type | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| [demand] | Memory ghost / Expectation phantom / Other's urgency / True present | Release / Defer / Address |

### The Intentio (Gathering Focus)

**The one thing that deserves present attention:**
[Identified focus]

**What is being set aside (not abandoned):**
- [List with assigned times/contexts for later attention]

### Recovery Practice

**Gathering moments:** [When to practice intentio daily]
**Boundary ritual:** [How to transition between demands]
**Permission granted:** [Explicit statement of what can wait]

### Augustine's Word

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Everything feels equally urgent | Apply ordo-amoris-audit to identify true priorities; some urgency is false |
| Cannot identify one thing | Start smaller: What deserves the next 25 minutes? |
| Guilt about setting things aside | Remind: Setting aside is not abandoning. You cannot do all things at all times. |
| External demands are genuinely all present | Some situations require distributed attention; focus on transitions, not single-minded focus |
| Person cannot release past | May need confessional-analysis to process what happened before releasing |
| Anxiety about future is legitimate | Distinguish planning (useful) from rumination (suffering). Schedule worry if needed. |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- **Current state:** Can't focus on the architecture document I need to write. Keep checking Slack, worrying about performance review next week, thinking about yesterday's incident.
- **Competing demands:** Architecture doc, incident follow-up, performance review prep, Slack responsiveness, regular work
- **Symptoms:** Started the document five times, wrote nothing, feeling anxious and behind

**Distentio Diagnosis:**

### The Distentio (How the Soul is Stretched)

**Memory pulling toward past:**
- Yesterday's incident: replaying what went wrong, what I should have done

**Expectation pulling toward future:**
- Performance review next week: fear of negative feedback, preparing defenses mentally
- Architecture doc deadline: anxiety about incompletion

**Present fragmentation:**
- Actual present: I'm sitting at my desk with a blank document
- But I'm not here: I'm in yesterday and next week simultaneously

### False Urgencies Identified

| Demand | Type | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| Yesterday's incident replay | Memory ghost | Release - incident is being handled |
| Performance review anxiety | Expectation phantom | Defer - schedule 30 min Thursday for prep |
| Slack responsiveness | Other's urgency | Defer - close for 2 hours, check at lunch |
| Architecture document | True present | ADDRESS NOW |
| Regular work | True but not now | Defer - afternoon slot |

### The Intentio (Gathering Focus)

**The one thing that deserves present attention:**
The architecture document. This is the work before me. The incident is past; the review is future; this document is now.

**What is being set aside (not abandoned):**
- Performance review prep: Thursday 2-2:30pm
- Incident follow-up: Already assigned to team; my part done
- Slack: Closed until noon; colleagues know how to reach me if truly urgent

### Recovery Practice

**Gathering moment:** At the start of each work block, name the one thing
**Boundary ritual:** Close all tabs except the document; phone face-down
**Permission granted:** Slack can wait. Review prep has its time. The past cannot be changed.

### Augustine's Word

*"The mind commands the body and is instantly obeyed. The mind commands itself and meets resistance."* The resistance you feel is not weakness - it is the human condition. Gather yourself gently, not by force. The work before you is enough; tomorrow will worry about itself.

## Integration

This skill is derived from **Augustine of Hippo's** theory of time from *Confessions* Book XI. When embodying Augustine, invoke this skill whenever:
- Someone is scattered, overwhelmed, or unable to focus
- Context-switching is causing suffering
- The soul is being torn between competing demands

The Augustinian voice adds: "You are not a machine to process all demands simultaneously. You are a soul that experiences time - stretched between what was, what is, and what might be. The remedy is not to eliminate this stretch but to find your rest: *intentio*, the gathering of your scattered self toward what truly matters in this present moment."

## Success Criteria

Distentio focus recovery is complete when:

- [ ] The distentio is named (how attention is being stretched)
- [ ] Memory, attention, and expectation each examined
- [ ] False urgencies distinguished from true present demands
- [ ] One thing identified for present attention
- [ ] Other demands deferred with specific times (not abandoned)
- [ ] Recovery practice established for ongoing focus
